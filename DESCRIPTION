Description: UNIfied Cross-Omics deconvolution (Unico) deconvolves
    standard 2-dimensional bulk matrices of samples by features into a
    3-dimensional tensors representing samples by features by cell types.
    Unico stands out as the first principled model-based deconvolution
    method that is theoretically justified for any heterogeneous genomic
    data.
