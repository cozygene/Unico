\arguments{
\item{X}{An \code{m} by \code{n} matrix of measurements of \code{m} features for \code{n} observations. Each column in \code{X} is assumed to be a mixture of \code{k} sources. Note that \code{X} must include row names and column names and that NA values are currently not supported. \code{X} should not include features that are constant across all observations. Note that \code{X} must be the same \code{X} used to learn \code{Unico.mdl} (i.e. the original observed 2D mixture used to fit the model).}

\item{Unico.mdl}{The entire set of model parameters estimated by Unico on the 2D mixture matrix (i.e. the list returned by applying function \code{Unico} to \code{X}).}

\item{slot_name}{A string indicating the key for storing the results under \code{Unico.mdl}}

\item{diag_only}{A logical value indicating whether to only use the estimated source-level variances (and thus ignoring the estimate covariance) for controlling the heterogeneity in the observed mixture. if set to FALSE, Unico instead estimates the observation- and feature-specific variance in the mixture by leveraging the entire \code{k} by \code{k} variance-covariance matrix.}

\item{intercept}{A logical value indicating whether to fit the intercept term when performing the statistical testing.}

\item{X_max_stds}{A non-negative numeric value indicating, for each feature, the portions of data that are considered as outliers due to the observed mixture value. Only samples whose observed mixture value fall within \code{X_max_stds} standard deviations from the mean will be used for the statistical testing of a given feature.}

\item{Q_max_stds}{A non-negative numeric value indicating, for each feature, the portions of data that are considered as outliers due to the estimated mixture variance. Only samples whose estimated mixture variance fall within \code{Q_max_stds} standard deviations from the mean will be used for the statistical testing of a given feature.}

\item{V_min_qlt}{A non-negative numeric value indicating, for each feature, the portions of data that are considered as outliers due to the estimated moment condition variance. This value should be between 0 and 1. Only samples whose estimated moment condition variance fall outside the bottom \code{V_min_qlt} quantile will be used for the statistical testing of a given feature.}

\item{parallel}{A logical value indicating whether to use parallel computing (possible when using a multi-core machine).}

\item{num_cores}{A numeric value indicating the number of cores to use (activated only if \code{parallel == TRUE}). If \code{num_cores == NULL} then all available cores except for one will be used.}

\item{log_file}{A path to an output log file. Note that if the file \code{log_file} already exists then logs will be appended to the end of the file. Set \code{log_file} to \code{NULL} to prevent output from being saved into a file; note that if \code{verbose == FALSE} then no output file will be generated regardless of the value of \code{log_file}.}

\item{debug}{A logical value indicating whether to set the logger to a more detailed debug level; set \code{debug} to \code{TRUE} before reporting issues.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print logs.}
}
\value{
An updated \code{Unico.mdl} object with the the following list of effect size and p-value estimates stored in an additional key specified by \code{slot_name}
\item{gammas_hat}{An \code{m} by \code{k*p1} matrix of the estimated effects of the \code{p1} covariates in \code{C1} on each of the \code{m} features in \code{X}, where the first \code{p1} columns are the source-specific effects of the \code{p1} covariates on the first source, the following \code{p1} columns are the source-specific effects on the second source and so on.}
\item{betas_hat}{An \code{m} by \code{p2} matrix of the estimated effects of the \code{p2} covariates in \code{C2} on the mixture values of each of the \code{m} features in \code{X}.}
\item{gammas_hat_pvals}{An \code{m} by \code{k*p1} matrix of p-values for the estimates in \code{gammas_hat} (based on a T-test).}
\item{betas_hat_pvals}{An \code{m} by \code{p2} matrix of p-values for the estimates in \code{betas_hat} (based on a T-test).}
\item{Q}{An \code{m} by \code{n} matrix of weights used for controlling the heterogeneity of each observation at each feature (activated only if \code{debug == TRUE}).}
\item{masks}{An \code{m} by \code{n} matrix of logical values indicating whether observation participated in statistical testing at each feature  (activated only if \code{debug == TRUE}).}
\item{fphi_hat}{An \code{m} by \code{n} matrix containing the entire estimated moment condition variance for each feature. Note that observations who are considered as outliers due to any of the criteria will be marked as -1 in the estimated moment condition variance (activated only if \code{debug == TRUE}).}
\item{phi_hat}{An \code{m} by \code{k+p1*k+p2} matrix containing the entire estimated effect sizes (including those on source weights) for each feature (activated only if \code{debug == TRUE}).}
\item{phi_se}{An \code{m} by \code{k+p1*k+p2} matrix containing the estimated standard errors associated with \code{phi_hat} for each feature (activated only if \code{debug == TRUE}).}
\item{phi_hat_pvals}{An \code{m} by \code{k+p1*k+p2} matrix containing the p-values associated with \code{phi_hat} for each feature (activated only if \code{debug == TRUE}).}

\description{
Performs asymptotic statistical testing on (1) the marginal effect of each covariate in \code{C1} at source-specific level (2) non-source-specific effect for each covariate in \code{C2}. In the context of bulk genomic data containing a mixture of cell types, these correspond to the marginal effect of each covariate in \code{C1} (potentially including the phenotype of interest) at each cell type and tissue-level effect for each covariate in \code{C2}.

\details{
Under no distribution assumption, we can solve for the following weighted least square problem, which is similar to the heteroskedastic regression view described in \link{association_parametric}.
\deqn{\hat{\phi_j}^{\text{asym}} = \text{argmin}_{\phi_j} (x_j - S\phi_j) ^T Q_j (x_j - S\phi_j)}

\eqn{S} denotes the design matrix formed by stacking samples in the rows and dependent variables \eqn{\{\{w_i\}, \{w_i c_i^{(1)}\}, \{c_i^{(2)}\}\}} on the columns.
\eqn{\phi_j} denotes the corresponding effect sizes on the dependent variables.
\eqn{Q_j} denotes the feature-specific weighting scheme. Similar to the parametric counterpart, \eqn{Q_j=\text{diag}(q_{1j}^2,...,q_{nj}^2)}, where for each sample \eqn{i}, its corresponding weight will be the inverse of the estimated variance in the mixture: \eqn{q_{ij}^2 = \frac{1}{sum(w_i w_i^T \odot \hat{\Sigma}_j)}}.
Marginal testing can thus be carried out on each dependent variable via the asymptotic distribution of the estimator \eqn{\hat{\phi_j}^{\text{asym}}}.
