# Unico
There are the code implementation of a Unico, a unified cross-omics method designed to deconvolve standard 2-dimensional bulk matrices of samples by features into a 3-dimensional tensors representing samples by features by cell types. Unico stands out as the first principled model-based deconvolution method that is theoretically justified for any heterogeneous genomic data.

A R pacakge will be available soon on CRAN
